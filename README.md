# react-task-tracker
Task Tracker app built using React

I've been praticising developing my React skills, whilst mainly working on the front end and design in my current role, which is mainly based on Wordpress, HTML and CSS, with some Bootstrap and JS. My ideal next job role would be using React and JavaScript.

I've been making the most of my spare time to develop my React skills, creating components and practising using state and props.
